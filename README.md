> In Hamorigami, you play a day in the life of a tree spirit, Kodama.  
> 
> Kodama has a special link to its home, a bonsai tree: if the bonsai is healthy, so is Kodama. However, if the tree begins to wither, so will Kodama.
> 
> It’s your job as Kodama to protect its home by maintaining the balance.
> 
> Too many pesky Water Spirits will always lead to overwatering. And while some Sun Spirits are fine, they might dry out the soil too much.
> 
> Ganbatte!
