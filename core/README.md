# Hamorigami Developer Guide

This guide is for internal use only and is directed at developers of this game.

## Assets

Please put assets into the following directories:

| Directory        | Purpose           | Naming conventions  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| [assets/font](assets/font) | True Type (.ttf) fonts | fontname.ttf |

| [assets/game.play](assets/game.play) | The gameplay file | *.play |

## Gameplay file

The gameplay file `assets/game.play` contains instructions in how the story mode is supposed to be played:

```
# this is a comment and it won't get parsed

instruction1
instruction2

# another comment
instruction3
```
The following section describes various concepts in gameplay files, including syntax and examples:

### Starting a new day

```
day x
````
*`x` is the number of the day*

### Defining cutscenes

Cutscenes are a way to let things happen in the game **outside** of gameplay. The idea is that you can for example spawn spirits, let them talk and move and disappear again.

> **PLEASE NOTE! Cutscenes are currently only supported at the start and at the end of a day (both is optional)**

A cutscene block is defined like this:

```
begin cutscene
# cutscene instructions go here
end cutscene
```
The following explains various cutscene instructions you can use in order to define a cutscene.

#### The player and despawning

The cutscene editor treats the player slightly different from other entities. For example.
the player (kodama) is referred to as `player`, whereas the other spirits are referred to as their natural name.

The reason is that spawning a player during a morning cutscene **will not** despawn it at the end of a cutscene. Instead, once the gameplay starts, kodama can be controlled directly by the player. All other entities spawned within cutscenes will automatically disappear once a cutscene is over!

#### Spawning spirits (in a cutscene!)

```
entity spawns at x,y 
```
*`entity` is the type of spirit to spawn OR player*<br/>
*`x` is the horizontal position of the scene (0 is left)*
*`y` is the vertical position of the scene (0 is bottom)*

The following spirit entities are currently supported:

* ame
* hi
* player

#### Waiting

A very important concept is waiting. This allows certain things to happen before the cutscene continues.

> **PLEASE NOTE! By default, all cutscene steps are played at once, unless you specify waiting!**

```
wait x seconds
```
*`x` is the amount of seconds*

#### Fading in

When a spirit spawns, it directly appears. In order to control a fade effect, do the following right after the spawn instruction:
```
entity fades in for x seconds
```
*`entity` is the type of spirit to fade in OR player*<br/>
*`x` the number of seconds to fade in*

#### Movement

Entities can be moved during cutscenes. Currently, it is only possible to move entities relatively to their current position:
```
entity moves by x,y for 3 seconds looped
```
*`entity` is the type of spirit to move OR player*<br/>
*`x` the amount of pixels to move left or right (can be negative)*<br/>
*`y` the amount of pixels to move up or down (can be negative)*<br/>
*`looped` is completely optional and lets the entity move back and forth between the old and new position*

#### Speech

Entities can talk:
```
entity says sentence
```
*`entity` is the type of spirit that should say something OR player*<br/>
*`sentence` is the sentence the entity should say. Can be any string*<br/>

##### Translations
It is recommended to define sentences within the `assets/i18n` folder. 

For example within: `assets/i18n/translations.properties`
```
my.dialog.01=This is a dialog
```
and within: `assets/i18n/translations_DE.properties` you could define a German translation:
```
my.dialog.01=Das ist ein Dialog
```
Within the cutscene instruction, you then can automatically let the entity say the translated sentence:
```
player says my.dialog.01
```
Depending on the language configured on the operating system of the player, the language gets automatically loaded (English is default).

##### Multiple sentences
A player can say multiple sentences at once:
```
player says my.dialog.01
player says my.dialog.02
```
It is quite impossible for someone to say two things at the same time, so those sentences get shown after another.

#### Emotes

Entities can emote:
```
entity emotes with emote
```
*`entity` is the type of spirit that should emote something OR player*<br/>
*`emote` the kind of emote an entity should perform*<br/>

Currently supported emotes:

* `smile`
* `confusion`
* `sadness`
* `disagree`
* `agree`

#### Screen shake

You can shake the screen for a given amount of time with a given intensity:
```
shake with intensity a for b seconds
```
*`a` the intensity. Must be greater than 0*<br/>
*`b` the number of seconds to shake the screen*<br/>

#### Toggling states on entities

It is possible to enable or disable certain properties/states on entities, for example to make them do something very specific like a custom animation or effect.

```
# sets the property on the entity
entity starts activity
# removes the property from the entity
entity stops activity
```
Currently supported:

* `swiping` the player starts to brush around

#### Resetting an entity

During a cutscene, you might wanna stop any behavior or movement on a certain entity:
```
reset entity
```
*`entity` is the type of spirit that should be resetted OR player*<br/>

### Spawning spirits

Once a day has been defined, it is possible to spawn spirits in various ways.

> **PLEASE NOTE! You cannot define spawning before a morning cutscene or after an evening cutscene!**

The following spirit types are currently supported:

* `ame`
* `hi`
* `kodama`

#### Spawning at a given point in time

```
spawn type at x seconds
```
*`type` is the type of spirit to spawn*<br/>
*`x` is the amount of seconds*

It is also possible to spawn multiple spirits:
```
spawn 3x type at x seconds
```

#### Spawning at a progress of the day

```
spawn type at x%
```
*`type` is the type of spirit to spawn*<br/>
*`x` is the percentage of how much the day has already passed*

It is also possible to spawn multiple spirits:
```
spawn 5x type at x%
```

#### Spawning at a given chronological rate

```
spawn type every x seconds
```
*`type` is the type of spirit to spawn*<br/>
*`x` is the interval in seconds*

It is also possible to spawn multiple spirits in intervals:
```
spawn 3x type every x seconds
```

#### Spawning at a given progress rate

```
spawn type every x%
```
*`type` is the type of spirit to spawn*<br/>
*`x` is the percentage of the day as an interval*

It is also possible to spawn multiple spirits in intervals:
```
spawn 3x type every x%
```
#### Examples

```
# spawns 4x hi at the middle of the day
spawn 4x hi at 50%
# spawns 2x ame every 10 seconds
spawn 2x ame every 10 seconds
```
